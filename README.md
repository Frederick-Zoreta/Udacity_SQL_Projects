# Udacity_SQL_Projects
This was my first project for Udacity's SQL Nanodegree Program

Overview
Perform analysis on data stored in relational and non-relational database systems to power strategic
decision-making. Learn to determine, create, and execute SQL and NoSQL queries that manipulate and
dissect large scale datasets. Begin by leveraging the power of SQL commands, functions, and data cleaning
methodologies to join, aggregate, and clean tables, as well as complete performance tune analysis to
provide strategic business recommendations. Finally, apply relational database management techniques to
normalize data schemas in order to build the supporting data structures for a social news aggregator.
This Nanodegree program teaches the basic data-working skills needed to find and use insights gleaned
from large repositories of data that have outgrown their current abilities with spreadsheets. In addition, it
teaches students how to harness the full power of relational databases, as well as be aware of other types
of databases that exist and know when to choose which type. The ideal student has aspirations to develop
into a data professional, either in database management (IT) or in analytics (business).
Prerequisites: Anyone who has basic computer skills can understand and write SQL and NoSQL languages.
